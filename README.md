LCDNode - Clock
=======

Since I coded the origincal LCDNode, I moved country. In my new home I can't monitor my power due tot he location of my power feed, etc. This version of the LCD display changes the core function to being a clock and a display for my climate RF nodes. I have removed the power history and display functions.


Need to decide what to use the LEDs for yet.
